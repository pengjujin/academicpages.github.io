Welcome to my website! I was an Undergrad/Master's student at the Robotics Institute and Computer Science Department at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I have a strong research interest in Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning methods that help robots to make intelligent decisions under uncertainity. I will soon be joining [Aurora Innovation](https://aurora.tech/) in Pittsburgh and help bringing safe self-driving cars onto the road.  

My advisor is [Prof. Kris Kitani](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kkitani/) and [Prof. Siddhartha Srinivasa](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~siddh/) (Currently at University of Washington in Seattle). During my time at CMU, I worked as a research assistant in the [Personal Robotics Laboratory](https://personalrobotics.ri.cmu.edu/) and worked on various pose estimation and sensor fusion projects. My other responsibilities alsoincluded maintaining the perception pipeline and helped building HERB 3.0. In addition, I also worked on reinforcement learning projects involving a navigation assistaive robot for blind people known as the Cabot. Check out my publications and projects for details.

While I was at CMU, I also had a few summer internship at various companies including HP, Google and Apple. See my CV page for a more detailed list of my experiences.
