Although there is an abundance of planar fiducialmarker
systems proposed for augmented reality and computervision
purposes, using them to estimate the pose accurately in
robotic applications where collected data are noisy remains a
challenge. This is inherently a difficult problem because these
fiducial marker systems work solely within the RGB image space
and the resolution of cameras on robots is often constrained. As
a result, small noise in the image would cause the tagâ€™s detection
process to produce large pose estimation errors.
This paper describes an algorithm that improves the pose
estimation accuracy of square fiducial markers in difficult
scenes by fusing information from RGB and depth sensors.
The algorithm retains the high detection rate and low false
positive rate characteristics of fiducial systems while making
them much more robust to size, lighting and sensory noise
for pose estimation. The improvements make the fiducial tags
suitable for robotic tasks requiring high pose accuracy in the
real world environment.
